## Why "Overhype"?

The name "Overhype" isn't about promoting things beyond their worth. Instead, it's a playful nod to the genuine excitement and anticipation that new tech, great software, and amazing games can generate. We want to capture that feeling, channel it constructively, and provide content that lives up to the hype â€“ because it's genuinely valuable and interesting.

We're not just reporting the news; we're providing context, sparking conversations, and building a community around shared interests. We believe in thoughtful discussion, honest reviews, and celebrating the ingenuity that drives these industries forward.
